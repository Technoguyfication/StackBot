# StackBot
StackOverflow Discord bot. Grabs questions from StackOverflow and puts them in chat. Go robots!

## Compiling / Running
_I don't recommend you host your own version of StackBot, instead, please invite StackBot to your server with [this link](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=197519430366920704&scope=bot&permissions=84992)._

1. Either clone this repo or download the zip archive of it. **(Cloning is recommended - this allows the bot to update itself with the `update` command)**
2. Run `npm update` in the `src` directory of the repo. (Note - If you don't have Visual Studio and Python installed, some errors may occur at this time. Please disregard these)
3. Inside the `src` folder, run `node index.js` to start stackbot.
